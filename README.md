**For example**

You can use `pigit -s` to check what short command it supported, it will display the corresponding help information and the original command, like this:

```
These are short commands that can replace git operations:
    b        lists, creates, renames, and deletes branches.
             git branch
    bc       creates a new branch.
             git checkout -b
    bl       lists branches and their commits.
             git branch -vv
    bL       lists local and remote branches and their commits.
             git branch --all -vv
    bs       lists branches and their commits with ancestry graphs.
             git show-branch
    bS       lists local and remote branches and their commits with ancestry graphs.
             git show-branch --all
    bm       renames a branch.
             git branch --move
    bM       renames a branch even if the new branch name already exists.
             git branch --move --force
    bd       delete a local branch by name.
             git branch -d
    c        records changes to the repository.
             git commit --verbose
......
```

### Interaction

It support a simple interactive mode. You can use `pigit ui` into the interactive mode and it let control the working tree simpler. like this:

![interaction demo](./interaction.gif)

And in the interaction mode, you can use `?` or `h` to see the help message.

### Open remote

You can use `pigit open` to open your remote website (just support **github**). These are some other parameters this command supported:

```bash
  -i, --issue:
      open given issue of the repository.
      # pigit open -- -i 20
      # pigit open -- --issue=20
  -c, --commit:
      open the current commit in the repo website.
      # pigit open -- --commit
  -p, --print:
      only print the url at the terminal, but don't open it.
  <branch>:
      open the page for this branch on the repo website.
```

## Alias

Alias is recommended for faster use _pigit_. Open your shell profile and append:

```bash
alias g=pigit
```

Then, you can use `g` to call pigit.

## Configuration

You can use `pigit --create-config` to create a template configuration at **pigit** home path.

On Linux or MacOS: `~/.config/pigit`

On windows should be: `C:\\User\\<your username>`

[here](./docs/pigit.conf) is a configuration template.

## Extra cmds

You can setting your custom cmds. It need create a `extra_cmds.py` file at the **pigit** home. And writing like this:

```python
import os

def print_user(args):
    print(os.system('whoami'))

extra_cmds = {
    'echo': {
        'command': 'echo 123',
    },
    'print-user': {
        'command': print_user,
        'type': 'func',
        'help': 'print system user name.'
    }
}
```

The `extra_cmds` dict is must. And the structure is command key and command info.

The command info has some options:

- `command`: (Must have) Short life corresponds to the complete command or a method. If it is a method, it must receive a parameter tuple.
- `type`: (Option) Mark the type of command, support ['func', 'command'], and the default is 'command'.
- `help`: (Option) Command help message.
- `has_arguments`: (Option, bool) Whether the command accepts parameters. Default is True.
